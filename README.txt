Chris Jarvis's Movie Trailer Website Generator

Running my_movies.py with python interpreter will generate and open an html file in 
your browser displaying 6 movies with their title, year, poster, and a trailer if you
click on the image.

Make sure that media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py are in the same directory as my_movies.
py otherwise it will not run correctly.

I added two lines to fresh_tomatoes.py so that the webpage displays the year the movie
was released.
